                            <p>This is the most obvious way to offer something special to your members, but it isn't always easy decide what you should offer.</p>

                            <p>I'm going to share two different ideas for members only content. The first, value content, appeals to your audience from a learning and business perspective, while the second, insider content, appeals to your audience from a more curious angle. Either approach can be effective. Ideally you find a way to use them both.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Value content is content that will help your readers make money or do something they're really interested in. If you're writing great content about DIY home improvement, like Young House Love, one idea would be to write a weekly post with a special members only do it yourself project. Another idea would be to include a printable PDF step by step guide for members in each renovation style post. This is value content. It's especially useful and relevant to your readers.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Insider content gives your audience some insight into you and your work routine or life. Humans are naturally curious and interested in people we admire. Entire TV shows and magazines are dedicated to documenting celebrity life. How you can you turn this curiosity into an idea for your membership site? In the Young House Love example, Sherry and John could include some behind the scenes video they took while completing a renovation, or maybe a blooper reel of mistakes made during the process. They could also do a quick members only video explaining the thought process behind a home improvement project.
